      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        I was born in Pleasant Hill, California, but moved to Omaha, Nebraska,
        when I was young. Growing up in Omaha, I quickly adapted to the Midwest
        lifestyle and developed a strong connection to the community. I attended
        Burke High School, where I made great friends and built lasting
        memories. My interest in technology and problem-solving led me to pursue
        further education after high school.
      </p>
      <p>
        I earned my Information Technology degree from Metropolitan Community
        College, which gave me a solid foundation in the tech field. Learning
        about computers, networking, and software development helped shape my
        career aspirations. While I haven’t worked as a developer, I enjoy
        exploring new technology and keeping up with the latest trends in the IT
        industry. My education has also helped me with personal projects, such
        as fixing and improving my own devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="sentence">Family is very important to me, and I take great pride in being a
        parent.</span> I have three amazing kids-two boys and a girl, who keep my life
        full of excitement and joy. Watching them grow and helping them navigate
        life is one of my greatest rewards. I strive to be a supportive and
        encouraging parent, always making time for family activities and
        creating meaningful experiences with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work and family, I have several hobbies that keep me engaged
        and entertained. I love playing guitar and working on cars, as both
        allow me to be creative and hands-on. Video games are another passion of
        mine, providing a fun way to relax and challenge myself. I also enjoy
        spending time with friends, whether it’s just hanging out or
        participating in group activities. These hobbies help me stay balanced
        and bring enjoyment to my daily life.
